# Weather Dashboard
Server-Side-APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description

The purpose of this project is to access data from Open Weather Map APIs to build a weather dashboard that contains dynamically updated HTML and CSS. In addition, the work day scheduler demonstrates the following jQuery skills:
 * make requests with specific parameters to retrieve data functionality from multiple APIs
 * store persistent data in local storage

In order to meet requirements, the deployed weather dashboard application should have the following capabilities:
 * displays a form input for searching by city
 * displays the current and future weather conditons
 * the current weather conditions contain the following:
        - city name
        - current date
        - icon representation of weather conditions
        - temperature
        - wind speed
        - humidity
 * the future weather conditions contain 5-days of forecasts containing the following:
        - date
        - icon representation of weather conditions
        - temperature
        - wind speed
        - humidity
 * clicking on a city in the search history presents the current and future conditions for that city
